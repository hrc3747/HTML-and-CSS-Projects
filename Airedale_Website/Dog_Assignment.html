	<h1>About Airedale Terriers</h1>
	<blockquote cite="https://soar-airedale-rescue.com/About-Airedales/37-about-airedales">
	Airedales are very devoted companions, but they fully expect to be an equal partner in your life.  They seem to have a sense of humor about themselves and you, so you had better develop the ability to see humor in all situations.  Like when they steal your keys just as you are about to leave for work and run around the back yard with them daring you to try and catch them. Airedales do not respond well to being excluded from family life.  You cannot expect an Airedale to be happy and well adjusted if he/she is confined to the backyard or to a single room in the house.
